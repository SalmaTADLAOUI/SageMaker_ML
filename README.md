# XGBoost Model on Boston Housing Dataset Deployment Lab

## Overview

This lab provides a step-by-step guide on training an XGBoost model, fine-tuning its hyperparameters, and deploying it using Amazon SageMaker on AWS. The main goal is to showcase the process of building, training, and deploying a machine learning model in a production-ready environment.

## Files

- **xgboost.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and instructions for the entire lab. It covers the following sections:
  - Loading and preprocessing the dataset
  - Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets
  - Fine-tuning hyperparameters of the XGBoost model
  - Uploading datasets to Amazon S3
  - Setting up the XGBoost estimator in SageMaker
  - Training the XGBoost model
  - Deploying the trained model
  - Making predictions using the deployed model

## Prerequisites

Before starting the lab, make sure you have:

- AWS account with the necessary permissions for SageMaker and S3.
- Jupyter Notebook installed locally or access to a platform where you can run Jupyter Notebooks.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine or your preferred Jupyter Notebook environment.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. **Open the Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `xgboost.ipynb` notebook.

```bash
jupyter notebook xgboost.ipynb
```

3. **Follow the Steps**: Execute each cell in the notebook, following the instructions provided. This includes loading the dataset, splitting the data, fine-tuning the XGBoost model, and deploying it using SageMaker.

4. **Explore Deployment**: Once the model is deployed, explore how to make predictions using the deployed endpoint. Understand the deployment configurations and considerations.

## Cleanup

After completing the lab, make sure to clean up resources to avoid unnecessary costs. This may include stopping or deleting the SageMaker endpoint and deleting any unused S3 buckets.
